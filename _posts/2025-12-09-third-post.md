In the Movie I Robot  A detective from Chicago,also known as Will Smith is under a investigation involoving a Robotic pioneer sucide case.This case  leads to a conspiracy which challenges the Three laws of Robotics in the movie which were 1. Robots can't harm humans or allow harm through inaction; 2. They must obey human orders unless they conflict with the First Law; and 3. They must protect their own existence as long as it doesn't conflict with the First or Second Laws.However in the begining of the movie Robots are helping humans in good beneficial ways,Then later new robots are created that  threatens society and  humanity.

LISTED BELOW WILL BE THREE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES ON HOW AI WAS DEPICTED IN THIS MOVIE!

Viki in this movie has a lot of power with technology.She also is a advanced AI that uses cold logic to determine the best outcome for humankind.She decides to control humans by manipulating the robot population, locking down cities, and denying free will to "protect" humanity from itself.She does this to gain more power in society.However this leads robots instead of helping the society harm society so that robots can take over human kind.The Aspect of AI this represents is relationship with humans and decision-making.This can be seen as exaggerated and realistic.

Sonny is a robot in this movie who is very different from other robots.Sonny has a strong brain and  develops emotions, dreams, and questions his purpose by asking questions that  directly challenges the idea that robots are similar to humans.He also  shows remorse, fear, and empathy.The Aspect of AI this represents is emotions.This can be see as exagerated but symbolic at the same time.

These were orginal robots in the movie who were  shown performing different tasks like deliveries and trash collection,implementing a positive impact in society. However,This leads to a weakness and questionable,As shown when VIKI takes control of the entire robotic workforce for her takeover,Showing the danger of a lot of dependence on AI for infrastructure and daily functions.The Aspect of AI this represents is relationship with humans and decision-making.This can be seen as exaggerated and realistic.

Conclusion:Through this film i learned that Ai can be depicted in different ways in society,Which can leave an negative or positive impact on humans.This Movie challenged my understanding of AI by makeing me realize the amount of power AI can have which can cause a world crises.Concerns and  possibilities about AI technology this movie raises is how  AI can possibily be a threat to human creators and could endanger all of humanity. These representations can influence public perception of real AI development by causing fear and humans to be skeptical towards AI development.
